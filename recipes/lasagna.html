    <h2>Desription</h2>
    <p>This is my grandma's best lasagna recipe, except I use sour cream instead of ricotta (a trick I picked up from my mother-in-law).</p>
    <p>She always made it for birthdays and special occasions. This makes a large amount, so I halve it when making it for my boyfriend and myself. It's very cheesy, so sometimes I add a little extra tomato sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground pork sausage</li>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, and garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat</li>
        <li>Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce,</li>
        <li>When the sauce has simmered for about 15 minutes</li>
        <li>tir sour cream, 1/2 of the mozzarella</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce evenly</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the cheese</li>        
    </ol>
